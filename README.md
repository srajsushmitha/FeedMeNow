It's a food delivery application which currently uses swiggy's APIs as initial base. I have used React, redux and tailwind css. As it's a small application, I have also demonstrated contexts instead of using Redux for state management. 
If the application is not working, Swiggy might have changed their API structure:) Please let me know if the app's not working at the time you visit my project.
